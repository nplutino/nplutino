- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nplutino, a Physics graduated student who has worked as data scientist for the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and for Serco Italia.
- I had the chance to analyse data from GOES satellites (NASA) and produce a new list of solar flare events, realized in collaboration with the Solar Physics Group of the
University of Rome "Tor Vergata". You can find the list of events in the FlareList folder, together with a tool to select and download data from a specific period of time.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis and Big Data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL to enanche the data share process related to my work with GOES data.
